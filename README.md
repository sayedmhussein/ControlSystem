## Project Overview
This project is created to be milestone for applications which could be used for building applications to control internal operations for organization or companies.

Thanks for open soure community for inspiring such activity, currenly the source code is uploaded in github, feel free to contribute or use it for your application.

## Configuration instructions
In order to use this application you need to do the following:

1. Prepare your backend database connection string, it is recommended to use postgres as backend database.
2. Prepare your backend file storage connection string, you can use your own server directory <mark>Currently Not Ready</mark>.

## Operating instructions
<del>“What is this? Where does this go?” Now is the time to demystify any assumptions around how to use your project.</del>

## A list of files included
<del>Contingent upon how large your source code is, you may opt to not include the file tree, however you can still explain how to traverse through your code. For example, how is your code modularized? Did you use the MVC (Model, View, Controller) method? Did you use a Router system? Just a few questions to consider when detailing your file structure.</del>

## Copyright and licensing information
<del>In order to let others know what they can and cannot do with your code, it is important to include a software license in your project. If you opt out of using a license then the default copyright laws will apply and you will retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. Hence the reason licenses are critical and highly recommended for open source projects.</del>
